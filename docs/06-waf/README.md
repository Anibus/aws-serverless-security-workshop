# Module 6: WAF 

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. For example, you can reject requests that matches **SQL injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. Additionally, you can filter web requests based on **IP address**, **geographic area**, **request size**, and/or string or **regular expression** patterns using the rules. You can put these conditions on HTTP headers or body of the request itself, allowing you to create complex rules to block attacks from specific user-agents, bad bots, or content scrapers. You can also take advantage of **Managed Rules** from **AWS Marketplace** to get immediate protections for your APIs from common threats, such as OWASP Top 10 security risks and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).


In this module, you will create a WAF ACL and attach it to the API Gateway we created.
